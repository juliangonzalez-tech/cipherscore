# CipherScore

CipherScore is a privacy-first password strength checker and generator built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and zxcvbn. It analyzes passwords locally in the browser, offers optional breached-password checking with k-anonymity, and presents the whole experience in a polished dark UI designed for a portfolio.

## Product plan

- Build one focused landing page with two core utilities: a password checker and a password generator.
- Keep all strength estimation local in the browser using `zxcvbn`.
- Add an optional Have I Been Pwned range query so only a SHA-1 prefix leaves the client during breach checks.
- Prioritize a premium, minimal UI that feels startup-quality rather than classroom-demo quality.
- Keep the codebase intentionally small, readable, and easy to run.

## UI breakdown

- Hero section with strong product framing
- Main checker card for analysis and breach checking
- Generator card for passwords and passphrases
- Privacy section explaining local-first behavior
- How it works section for portfolio reviewers
- Minimal footer

## Security and privacy approach

- Password scoring runs in-browser only
- Raw passwords are never stored
- Raw passwords are never sent for local strength analysis
- Breach checks are optional
- Breach checks only send the first 5 SHA-1 characters to the upstream range API
- No login, no database, no analytics, no ads

## Why this is different

Most password checkers are either simplistic score meters or privacy-light marketing tools. CipherScore is different because it combines realistic client-side analysis, actionable coaching, optional breach awareness, and a genuinely polished interface in one minimal product. The app is designed to show both engineering judgment and product thinking.

## Stack

- Next.js 14
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- zxcvbn

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Design choices

- `zxcvbn` was chosen over regex-only scoring because it better models realistic human password behavior.
- The dark graphite palette helps the product feel premium and security-focused.
- The UI is intentionally compact and uncluttered so the privacy message stays clear.
- The breach check is separated from the default flow so the local-first promise stays obvious.

## Future improvements

1. Add a richer passphrase word list and localization support.
2. Add offline caching for breach-prefix responses to reduce repeated lookups.
3. Visualize password entropy and attack scenarios in more depth.
4. Add unit tests for generator logic and breach parsing.
5. Add side-by-side comparisons between weak and improved password examples.
